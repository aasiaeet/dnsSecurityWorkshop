Stream deinterleaving is an important problem with various
applications in the cybersecurity domain.  In this paper, we consider
the specific problem of deinterleaving DNS data streams using
machine-learning techniques, with the objective of automating the
extraction of malware domain sequences.  We first develop a model for
user request generation and DNS stream interleaving.  Based on these
we evaluate various inference strategies for deinterleaving including
augmented HMMs, RNNs and LSTMs on synthetic datasets.  Our results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art LSTMs outperform more traditional
RNNs and HMMs in this application domain.
