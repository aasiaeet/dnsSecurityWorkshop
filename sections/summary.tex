\section{Conclusion}

This paper describes our foray into the application of advanced 
deep-learning techniques to the problem of deinterleaving DNS-based
time-series sequences.  To this end, we developed an HsMM-based model
of user request generation and an AHMM-based model of the interleaving
process at the resolver queue.  We then evaluated the efficacy of two
different inference strategies for deinterleaving on a XSsynthetic
dataset.  Our results suggest that LSTM-based strategies significantly
outperform traditional AHMM-based models.  In future work, we plan to
extend this analysis on signficantly larger datasets to the specific
problem of malware domain group extraction.
